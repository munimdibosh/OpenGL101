 IAC Seminar Room of BUET usin openGL
======================================

Introduction
============
It was done as a part of the Computer Graphics course. While completing the project I faced lots of silly difficulties due to lack of proper guidelines and references. A sample project could be of great help which is simple and of beginner level. I didn't find one and so I decided to share my one for the people trying hard to get started in 3D graphics programming using openGL.

Dependency
===========
The project is compiled in *XCode*. If you don't have a Macbook/Mac PC then you can still use the source simply by putting them to your source folder in *Visual Studio* or *codeBlocks* project.

Open Source
===========
This is an Open Source project. If you could add some other interesting stuffs don't forget to shoot a `mail`_. I would love to know.
